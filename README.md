# Task 2 - Image Encryption

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my Cybersecurity Internship.  
In this task, I implemented **Image Encryption and Decryption** using Python.  
The main goal of this project is to protect image data from unauthorized access by applying simple encryption techniques.

## ⚙️ Features
- Encrypts an image using a secret key 🔐  
- Decrypts the image back to its original form  
- Works with different image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)  
- Prevents image misuse or data leakage  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- NumPy  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthikreddymorapelly/SCT_CS_2.git
   cd SCT_CS_2
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python image_encryption.py
Enter the encryption key (number) when prompted.

Use the same key for encryption and decryption.

📂 Example
Original Image → sample.jpg

Encrypted Image → encrypted.png

Decrypted Image → Back to original
